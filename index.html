      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Raunak Singh. I am from India and currently living in London.

      <h2>Why Web Development?</h2>
      <p>
        During my college years, I had a subject related to web development,
        where I studied HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I found it really
        interesting, which inspired me to pursue a career as a web developer.
        <br /><br />
        I started my career as a software trainee, where I learned HTML, CSS, a
        little bit of JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Photoshop. <br /><br />

        After that, I got my first job as a Digital Designer, where I maintained
        existing files and created new websites for various events using HTML,
        CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and a bit of PHP. I also designed ads,
        logos, brochures, banners, etc.<br />
        <br />
        Later, I got my next job as a Front-End Developer, where I worked on the
        front-end using Bootstrap and JavaScript. Meanwhile, I also started
        learning React.js.<br /><br />

        However, after moving to London, things turned out to be more
        challenging than I had imagined. So, I decided to focus on improving my
        coding skills.

      <h2>why I want to attend Founders and Coders programm?</h2>
      <p>
        I believe Founders and Coders is its emphasis on pair programming,
        mentorship, and practical experience, which will help me refine my
        coding skills while also developing important soft skills like teamwork
        and communication. Additionally, the programâ€™s focus on social impact
        projects aligns with my desire to use technology for meaningful
        solutions.
